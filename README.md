# Optimizing-Ansatz-Design-in-QAOA-for-Max-cut
The repository contains the code to find the probability of error for the traditional QAOA ansatz, and the proposed Edge coloring and Depth First Search Based Ansatz. This code was written in the IBM Quantum Lab (https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/lab). Therefore, some of the imports are strictly the IBM Quantum Lab requirements. In order to run it in local device, you need to install a local version of Qiskit, and may require to add or remove a few imports.

Requirements: In order to run this code, one requires Python3 and Qiskit. The used Qiskit version is 0.17.4. However, it should work with other versions of Qiskit as well.

This research was done in collaboration with IBM India Research Lab. The collaborators are Ritajit Majumdar, Dhiraj Madan, Debasmita Bhoumik, Dhinakaran Vinayagamurthy, Shesha Raghunathan and Susmita Sur-Kolay. The corresponding paper can be found in arXiv:
